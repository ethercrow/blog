Where   [Merchant Venturers Building - University of Bristol](https://goo.gl/maps/x3q61a3zbyTfc7ZH6)

</div>

Anyone interested in Haskell is welcome to attend. Whether you are a beginner or
an expert it would be great to meet you in Bristol.

It is a no-frills hackathon, we'll provide a room for hacking and wifi but expect little else!
There will be no t-shirts, food, talks or other perks. The focus will be 100% on
hacking and meeting other Haskell programmers.

## Venue

The hackathon will take place on the main University of Bristol campus in the
Merchant Venturers Building. This is in central Bristol so there are many
different options for accommodation, places to eat and things to do.

thank you to the organiser of ZuriHac for making it so easy to customise and
use for our event.

## Projects

TBC - You can describe projects you're interested in working on when
registering.

## Getting to Bristol

If you are travelling within the UK then the easiest way to get to Bristol
is either by train or bus. The venue is within walking distance of both the bus and train (Temple Meads) stations.
There is also a bus route (8/9) which goes from the train station to near the
campus.

If you wish to fly to Bristol then there are also two good options.

1. Fly to Bristol Airport, then take a connecting bus to Bristol.
2. Fly to London Heathrow and take a coach (2hr 30, [National Express](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en) or [megabus](https://uk.megabus.com/)).

Flying
to Bristol is much more convenient, the airport serves less destinations but it still
of a reasonable size.
It is also possible to fly to Gatwick but the coach takes 3hr 30 from there.

## Motivation

I was motivated to organise
the hackathon after attending Munihac in 2018 and meeting a lot of people who
I had never met before. In particular, I met many Germans and Austrians who were
interested in Haskell but not motivated to travel to Zurihac or other
international events. Therefore, it occurred to me that there must also be a similar
community of people in the UK. The UK has been lacking hackathons in recent years so
I decided to organise one myself and to get to know other Haskell programmers
here as well.

## Organisers

I (Matthew Pickering) am the main organiser of the event. Please [email](mailto:matthewtpickering@gmail.com) me
