Refactoring is changing the structure of a program without changing the functionality.

Many of the problems in (@Thompson2001a)

Since then, many tools have been developed which could greatly benefit from an additional abstraction layer.

## Functional Refactorings (25)


## Tool support for Refactoring Functional Programs

### Considerations

1. Side-effects
2. Semantics-based transformations
3. Comments

## Intial approach

"a complete compiler frontend if needed" @Li2003

Haskell-src(-exts) didn't provide type information

Programatica frontend was used.

### Strafunski

### Pretty Printing





## Porting to the GHC API

@Ryder2005

## Bitrotting



## GHC Problems

### Landmines

### Parser entry points

### Lack of information to pp

## `ghc-exactprint`
