title: Tools for working on GHC
---

In the old days of the Make build system, the only reliable IDE-like feature
which was useful whilst working on GHC was a tags file. Even loading GHC into GHCi
was not easily possible, the most simple of interactive development workflows.
Thankfully now times are changing, there are now build targets to start a GHCi
session which enables developers to use tooling such as [ghcid](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid) or [vscode-ghc-simple](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dramforever.vscode-ghc-simple).
Something which is quite important when working on a project with over 500 modules!

In this post we'll briefly describe some recent advancements in developer tooling
which have been made possible by the move to Hadrian.

## `ghci`

The first target allows a developer to load GHC into GHCi. The `-fno-code`
option is used which means that you can't evaluate any expressions. It
is useful for rapid feedback.

## `ghcid`

`ghcid` can be used whilst working on `ghc` by invoking the `./hadrian/ghci.sh` target.

<script id="asciicast-HAu0U5cVbneuujaoUA92Nxld5" src="https://asciinema.org/a/HAu0U5cVbneuujaoUA92Nxld5.js" async></script>

There is a `.ghcid` file included [in the repo](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/blob/master/.ghcid) which includes some basic
settings instructing `.ghcid` to reload the session if `hadrian/` changes. It
might also be useful to add further directories here so that working with the
many components of `ghc` is seamless.

## `haskell-ide-engine`

Once you have a working `ghci` target then in theory it becomes possible
to use all other tooling with your build system. I realised that it would be
possible to get `haskell-ide-engine` working with `ghc` but it required a [very
significant refactor](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/pull/1126).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s a short demo of using haskell-ide-engine on GHC&#39;s code base using my fork which integrates HIE into hadrian/cabal/rules_haskell/stack/obelisk <a href="https://t.co/rA1ps7dSb1">pic.twitter.com/rA1ps7dSb1</a></p>&mdash; Matthew Pickering (@mpickering_) <a href="https://twitter.com/mpickering_/status/1110874588509016064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As a result, the branch can't easily be merged back into the main repo but once
it is merged then `haskell-ide-engine` will be more flexible and target agnostic.

## Future work: running `:main`

A final [goal](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/16672)
is to be able to run GHC's `main` function from inside the
interpreter. In order to do this it's necessary to interpret the code rather
than pass `-fno-code`. With some modifications to the `./hadrian/ghci.sh` script
and patches by Michael Sloan we have been able to load load `ghc` into `GHCi`
in the interpreted mode.

Unfortunately, this isn't enough as in order to build programs with `HEAD`
you also need to build libraries such as `base` with `HEAD`. The way around
this is to first compile stage2 and then use the stage2 compiler to launch GHCi
and load GHC into that. Then the libraries will be the correct versions and can be
used to compile other modules.

A few months ago I got this working but since then it seems that the workflow
[has been broken](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/16797). It's a
bit unfortunate that you have to jump through so many hoops in order to compile
even a simple module but this is a unavoidable consequence of how GHC compiles
and uses modules.

### GHCi Debugger

Once you can execute `:main`, you can also use the GHCi debugger to debug GHC
itself! This works without any problems but until you can use `:main` to compile
programs then its of limited utility. I used the debugger to find the original
reason why `:main` was failing whe compiling a program.
