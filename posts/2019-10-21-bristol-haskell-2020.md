I have decided to organise an informal hackathon in Bristol at the start of
next year.

------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When    25th-26th January 2020
Where   [Merchant Venturers Building - University of Bristol](https://goo.gl/maps/x3q61a3zbyTfc7ZH6)
Time    09:00 - 17:00

Anyone interested in Haskell is welcome to attend. Whether you are a beginner or
an expert it would be great to meet you in Bristol.

It is a no-frills hackathon, we'll provide a room for hacking and wifi but expect little else!
There will be no t-shirts, food, talks or other perks. The focus will be 100% on
hacking and meeting other Haskell programmers.

For further information about the event and how to register please refer to the
dedicated page.
