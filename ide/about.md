A whole team of us are working this summer on Haskell tooling projects in order
to take Haskell tooling to the next level. Starting from the solid foundations
of [`ghcide`](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide) we are building [`haskell-language-server`](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/) which will suceed [`haskell-ide-engine`](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine) as the IDE of choice for Haskell developers.

We are focused on building a robust IDE experience which works on any Haskell project,
built with any build system and of any size.

## How to get involved?

If you want to get involved the best way is to come and chat to us in the
[\#haskell-ide-engine](irc://irc.freenode.net/haskell-ide-engine) IRC channel on Freenode. There's still plenty of rough
edges and there is a strong community of developers of different experience levels
to help and mentor any new contributors.
