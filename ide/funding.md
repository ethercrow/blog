## How can I contribute financially to the project?

We have set up an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/haskell-language-server) in order to take donations directly from the community. This will create
a more sustainable income stream than one-off yearly investments from Google.

We will use this money in order to place bounties on open issues which we
deem in need of incentivisation. For example, the packaging of binaries
for all the major platforms.

Thank you to all our current contributors who are supporting the project with
their donations.

## Other Funding

This summer IDE development is lucky to be funded by two different sources.
Firstly there are three projects funded by [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and one project funded by [tweag.io](https://www.tweag.io/).
