title: About
---

I am currently a PhD student at the University of Bristol supervised by
Dr Nicolas Wu. My research interests are to do with functional programming,
in particular I am interested in how to optimise high-level declarative programs.

Previously I studied Computer Science & Philosophy at the University of Oxford.
